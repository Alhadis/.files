.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command was originally an alias for
.Xr atom 1 ,
hence the name (\(lq@\(rq being an abbreviation of \(lqAt\(rq-om).
.Pp
Because Atom is unsupported on
.Ox ,
the alias was later replaced with a shell-script to launch Emacs instead whenever Atom is unavailable.
.Pp
In September 2025, the
.Nm
command was completely rewritten,
adding the options
.Fl -which ,
.Fl -version ,
and
.Fl -dry-run ,
and extending editor lookups to include
.Xr atom-beta 1 ,
.Xr pulsar 1 ,
and
.Xr vi 1 .

No efforts are made to accommodate the preferences of other users.
This command was selfishly written with its author\(cqs own use in-mind,
so the selection of editors is hard-coded and arbitrary.

.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.ad l
Atom was officially discontinued by GitHub on December 15th, 2022.
All projects under the Atom umbrella were archived and made read-only,
with the last releases published being
.Sy v1.63.0
and
.Sy v1.63.1 .
However, due to a security concern with code-signing certificates,
these versions were redacted,
making the most up-to-date (installable) release of Atom
.Sy v1.61.0-beta0 .
See
.Lk https://github.blog/?p=69758
for details regarding the revocation.
.
.Pp
A mirror of the (potentially-insecure) redacted v1.63.1 release is available from
.Lk https://archive.org/details/atom-v1.63.1 Archive.org .
This version includes the same changes published in
.Sy v1.61.0-beta0 ;
therefore, users are strongly encouraged to install this version instead.
